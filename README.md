## Fall Detection Algorithm
For our project, we have decided to create a fall detection program. Because falls are one of the major causes of serious injury, we want to create a program that will use accelerometer data to distinguish between falls and other activities, such as sitting or lying down. We want to do this by taking accelerometer data and using an orientation agnostic algorithm to smooth the data via rolling windows before we begin with feature extraction and model training. For feature extraction, we think that using time-domain features including number of peaks/troughs and variance of specific windows because those that include a fall will likely have more peaks/troughs and a greater variance. We also think that frequency domain feature Signal Energy will be useful as it measures the magnitude or intensity if data variations and windows with falls will have a much higher intensity than those without, thus giving us a better overall perspective on the overall robustness of periodicity within windows, allowing us to classify falls more clearly and distinguish falling from sitting/lying down/etc. Afterwards, we will use decision trees and confusion matrices with specific bounds to train and classify our data. Our goal with this project is to negate or reduce false alarms when it comes to fall detection as much as we can.
